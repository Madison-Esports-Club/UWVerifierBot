# Madison Esports Club Verification Bot
Despite the name, this bot does much more than just verification. It started as a way for us to let members of the esports club quickly confirm that they were current students at UW-Madison in order to gain access to campus-only events.

Since then, however, it has evolved into a tool for administering both our server and our website with quick and easy commands that require no knowledge of the underlying structure of either.

## Contribution
Currently the bot is maintained by Michael Verban (DMLooter) and Anton Gurevich (antgurevich). If you would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request, or talk to one of them to see if there is anything that needs doing. All pull requests must be approved by one of them.

If you would like to test the bot locally, you will need python 3.10 or later, and should install the requirements using pip3 -r requirements.txt.
Additionally, you will need a BotVariables.ini file in the directory to contain certain values (Talk to an admin to get setup)
